# FinalProject
1. For our final project we will be creating a board game that involves rolling a dice. We will add certain spaces that will make players either go back, lose a turn, ect.
2. I will be collaborating with Mike Woods.
3. I do not have any questions at the moment.

The main challenged we faced was making a player stay on the space they were supposed to, especially after landing on the special spaces. We figured out our problem was that we were using a double == whenever it should have been a single =. The one thing we did not get to add was having the game on a physical board that you could watch the game. We were not sure how to make this work. Overall I think we accomplished what we set out to do with the game, and the game works smoothly.
