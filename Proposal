## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Python Board Game
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A board game where you have to roll a dice to move forward to advance around the board. Certain spots on the board will require you to go backwards, forwards act...
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Our program will create a board game with around 50-100 different spaces and you have to roll a dice to move. Each player will have a different character and there will be special spots on the board. These spots will require the player to do a bunch of different things. It could require the player to move forward the same amount they rolled or move backwards.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A good outcome will be a working board game that has the special spaces. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome will have special rules. For example if a player rolls the same number on back to back turns they will get an extra roll.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome possible would be a completely working board game with different colored spaces and different characters that each player can choose. 

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Neither of us have ever created a board game, therefore creating the game in general will be a new skill. We will most likely make the game in python because 
it is the only language we are familiar with. We will also split the work evenly and do it all together. We will need to research how to make games in python and also how to add the special spaces we want. 
We will also need to research how to have the different spaces different colors.
